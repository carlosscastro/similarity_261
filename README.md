# similarity_261
Similarity measures for synonyms over google 5-gram data

TODOs 

* 5.4.1.c Sorting is broken because of exponential notation, fix it
* 5.4.1.ALL Report time and resources for each job
* 5.4.1.D revert X axis, looks funny (consult with professors)

* 5.5 Combiners for the 4 jobs (*only if needed because of latencies*)
* 5.5 Move the data to the full dataset once altiscale is working again
* 5.5 frequencies, use the passthru configuration so that the class receives the max and min limits through command line, so that for 5.7 we can just call the same jobs with different parameters [*Carlos implementing this*]


Not important IMO
* 5.4.1.ALL systems test with other systems test, just using 1 for now. I think it might be enough though
